Hello everybody
I would like to share with you these files to gather ideas and suggestions. Primarily about the file: formular.py where I developed some classes to either speed up 
data analysis or performance metrics required in ML excercises; or to provide an anwer that sklearn does not offer. Specifically, I programmed a class: BayesM, which calculates 
a Naive Bayes classification algorithm for a data base with continuous features (Gaussian likelihood) and categorical features (Bernoulli likelihood).
The files Churn_case and Cereals_case use these classes.

Thank you very much for all the imput you can provide.
